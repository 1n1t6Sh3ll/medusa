# Description

**MEDUSA** is an extensible, modular framework for automated dynamic runtime analysis of Android and iOS applications, built for penetration testers, mobile security researchers, and malware analysts. It serves as a centralized FRIDA script repository, allowing you to add or remove modules dynamically — combining hooks and behaviors into a single main script tailored to the needs of each pentest or malware analysis session. MEDUSA automates key tasks such as SSL-pinning bypasses, attack surface enumeration, network and WebView inspection, and proxy orchestration, while providing deep behavioral insight through API call tracing, memory inspection, cryptographic data extraction, and malware-specific monitoring (exfiltration, camera/mic abuse, SMS or call interception). With over 90 plug-and-play modules, MEDUSA makes large-scale instrumentation, triage, and behavioral investigation efficient, scalable, and reusable.

**System requirements:** 

- Linux or macOS (limited functionality available on Windows)
- Python 3
- Rooted device or emulator 
- adb
- FRIDA server (running on the mobile device)

# Installation

1.	Clone this repository.
2.	CD into the medusa directory.
3.	Install dependencies:

```sh
# using the system python3/pip
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# or inside a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### Using Docker

A preconfigured Dockerfile is available in the medusa/ directory.

1.	Build the image: `docker build -t medusa:latest ./`

2.	Run the container: `docker run --name medusa --net=host --rm -it medusa:latest`

3.	Enable ADB over TCP/IP on your physical device or emulator: `adb tcpip 5555`

4.	Connect to the device from inside the container: `root@docker# adb connect <device_ip>:5555`

## Known installation issues

### macOS 

During installation on macOS, you might encounter the following issue:

>Readline features including tab completion have been disabled because
no supported version of readline was found. To resolve this, install
pyreadline3 on Windows or gnureadline on Linux/Mac.

To resolve, install the gnureadline package for Python:

```
pip install gnureadline
```

For Python 3.12, use the following command to install gnureadline from a specific commit:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ludwigschwardt/python-gnureadline.git@8474e5583d4473f96b42745393c3492e2cb49224
```

## Database Migrations

If you're upgrading from an older version of Medusa and encounter database compatibility issues with Mango, please refer to [DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md](DATABASE_MIGRATIONS.md) for migration instructions.

**Important**: If you have an existing Mango database and receive errors after updating, check the migration guide to update your database schema.

## Quick start

### Using medusa.py

The main idea behind MEDUSA is to be able to add or remove hooks for Java or Native methods in a large scale while keeping the process simple and effective. MEDUSA has **more than** **90** modules which can be combined, each one of them dedicated to a set of tasks. Indicatively, some of these tasks include:

-  SSL pinning bypass
-  UI restriction bypass (e.g. Flag secure, button enable)
-  Class enumeration
-  Monitoring of:
   -  Encryption process (keys, IVs, data to be encrypted)
   -  Intents
   -  Http communications
   -  Websockets
   -  Webview events
   -  File operations
   -  Database interactions
   -  Bluetooth operations
   -  Clipboard
-  Monitoring of API calls used by malware applications, such as:
   -  Spyware
   -  Click Fraud
   -  Toll Fraud
   -  Sms Fraud
   
Furthermore, you can intercept Java or Native methods that belong to 3rd party apps or create complex frida modules with just few simple commands.

### Using mango.py

Mango is medusa's twin brother which can be used to:

- Parse and analyse the Android manifest
- Enumerate an application's attack entry points (exported activities, deeplinks, services etc.)
- Keep track of all your analysed applications
- Automate boring processes like: 
  - Set up a MITM
  - Patching 
  - Wrap adb commands 
  - Set/View/Reset the device's proxy configuration
  
...and many many more

## Using Stheno (Σθενώ) with Medusa

[Stheno](https://github.com/Ch0pin/stheno) is a subproject of Medusa, specifically designed for intent monitoring within this framework. Below is a quick guide on how to set up and use Stheno effectively.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Ch0pin/stheno/assets/4659186/fd49c39e-865b-4dc3-b2d1-59a0f4594028" alt="monitor" width="400"/>
</p>

1. **Include the Intent Module**:
   Add the `intents/start_activity` module to your Medusa project:
   ```bash
   medusa> add intents/start_activity
   ```

2. **Run the Socket Server**:
   Start the Medusa socket server to facilitate communication:
   ```bash
   medusa> startserver
   ```

3. **Launch Stheno**:
   Open Stheno and navigate to the Intent Monitor menu, then click on **Start** to begin monitoring intents.
